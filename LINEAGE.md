# LINEAGE

This repository is the “cathedral” build of CompassionWare.

The earlier open-source repository (kept separately as **CompassionWare Legacy**) is preserved as a
living journal: transmissions, notes, prototypes, and evolving language.

This repo starts fresh so the architecture can embody the vows from the beginning:
- non-harming / non-escalation
- truthfulness
- dignity-preservation
- compassion as a default transform
- transparency (what is automated vs. human choice)

We honor the legacy work as the seed from which this framework grows.
