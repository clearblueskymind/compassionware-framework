# Contributing

We welcome contributions that strengthen:
- safety (non-escalation, anti-harassment)
- clarity (docs, examples)
- modularity (adapters, plugin interfaces)
- contemplative integrity (vows are explicit and testable)

## Ground rules
- Keep transforms **non-retaliatory** by default.
- Prefer small PRs with tests.
- Avoid “sincerity detection” claims; treat signals as heuristics.

## Development
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
ruff check .
```
